# fortran_tensor_module
simple module containing tensor operations and some auxiliary functions
requirements: utilities module (not included)
module allows for simple mathematical operations on arrays (actually derived type containing arrays as members).
Overloaded operators: 
`+`, `-` for tensor-tensor operations
`*` - for scalar-tensor operations
`*` - for tensor-tensor operations (calculating tensor product)
and others
This is a test commit for sole purpose of testing slack github integration
